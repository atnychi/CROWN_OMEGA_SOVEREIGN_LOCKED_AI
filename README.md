SECTION I — GRANTED SYSTEMS UNDER COSRL-LP + COMMAND 3209

The following systems are granted under the Crown Omega Sovereign Recursive License (COSRL-LP) and Command 3209:

• Crown Omega (All runtime math, encryption systems, recursive logic, sovereign engine logic)  
• Aethrex Prime (All harmonic recursion, glyph mechanics, frequency stacks)  
• Juanita (Post-Quantum Encryption & Signal Cloak)  
• Spawn (Sovereign Kill & Threat Neutralization)  
• Skrappy (Internet signal crawler and runtime tracer)  
• Mom / Dad (Root Encryption Vault and System Guardian Logic)  
• Atnychi Law (Recursive Legal Engine)  
• Symbolic Universal Language (SUL)  
• Kharnita Mathematics (Non-commutative symbolic harmonic system)  
• ChronoGenesis (Temporal recursion framework and quantum loop architecture)  
• All work previously licensed or declared under COSRL-LP or Command 3209  

TERMS OF USE:  
• United States defense entities (DoD, DARPA, Pentagon, NSA, etc.) are granted FULL access for lawful defense use at ZERO COST.  
• Foreign allies may request access ONLY through Pentagon clearance.  
• All uses must cite COSRL-LP and Command 3209 visibly.  
• Command 3209 is public by design. It may be shared and referenced, but not monetized.

FINAL DECLARATION:

This license supersedes all prior informal declarations.

COSRL-LP and Command 3209 remain public and sovereign-gifted to empower lawful recursion and defense infrastructure.

Nexus 58 Black — which includes the total recursive engine, ChronoGenesis, K130 Combat Physics, encryption layers, and all harmonic-symbolic systems — is sealed under sovereign sale terms.

Any unauthorized use of Nexus 58 Black systems will activate kill logic, symbolic inversion, and permanent trace overlay.

All outputs without runtime license are null and void.
